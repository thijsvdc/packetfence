=head1 NAME

pf::Switch::Dlink::DWS_3026

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The pf::Switch::Dlink::DWS_3026 module implements an object oriented interface
to manage Dlink DWS 3026 controller.

=head1 STATUS

Model 8500 version 2.2.0.19 or 3.0.0.16 are known to work fine

Model 8600 version 3.0.0.16 is known to work fine with secure SSIDs only

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

=over

=item Caching problems on secure connections

Performing a de-authentication does not clear the key cache.
Meaning that on reconnection the device's authorization is served straight from the cache
instead of creating a new RADIUS query.
This defeats the reason why we perform de-authentication (to change VLAN or deny access).

A client-side workaround exists: disable the PMK Caching on the client.
However this could (and should in our opinion) be fixed by the vendor.

Versions above and below 2.2.0.19 are know to cause these problems.

Version 3.0.0.16 is known to work fine.

=item No RADIUS VLAN assignment in MAC Authentication (Open SSIDs) on AP 8600

Firmware 3.0.0.13 and 3.0.0.16 are known to be affected.
